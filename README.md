# Project1-Romeo

This project consists of a simple Tic Tac Toe game. The user plays against the program which randomly generates selections.
The board is numbered from 0 to 8, allowing the user to input a number in this range to make a selection.
Run ./ttt.sh to play the game.

Results from the game are stored in the file: results.csv
The header file in the results file represents the significance of every column of data.

Run ./analyzer.sh to collect some statistics from the results file.
Statistics are generated and stored in the stats.txt file.
